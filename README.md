## Program Index

1. [Array Insertion](./arrayInsertion.md)  
   Inserts an element into a specific position in an array.

2. [Linear Search](./linearSearch.md)  
   Searches for an element in an array using the linear search method.

3. [Binary Search](./binarySearch.md)  
   Efficiently searches for an element in a sorted array using binary search.

4. [Selection Sort](./selectionSort.md)  
   Sorts an array by selecting the smallest element in each pass.

5. [Insertion Sort](./insertionSort.md)  
   Sorts an array by inserting each element into its correct position.

6. [Bubble Sort](./bubbleSort.md)  
   Sorts an array by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements.

7. [Merge 2 Arrays](./merge2arrays.md)  
   Combines two arrays into one.

8. [Matrix Multiplication](./matrixMultiplication.md)  
   Multiplies two matrices and stores the result in another matrix.

9. [Stack Implementation](./stackOps.md)  
   Implements stack using arrays with push, pop, and display operations.

10. [Postfix Evaluation](./postfixEval.md)  
    Evaluates postfix expressions using stack.

11. [Queue Implementation](./simpleQueue.md)  
    Performs basic queue operations using arrays.

12. [Binary Search Tree](./binarySearchTree.md)  
    Creates a BST and performs inorder, preorder, and postorder traversals.
